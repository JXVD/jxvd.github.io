There are a lot of different input devices, [*a lot of different input devices*][input-devices]. So how do you even begin to grapple with what you'll let your player use? If you're like me, you probably only anticipate players using one specific kind of device for any one game you work on. This is reasonable as long as you are willing to take the hit when someone says "this game feels really bad on a Sega Bass Pro Fisherman Rod." Personally, I just say what kind of input device I expect the player to use in a Readme file. This is good because you only have to design for one input system, but it can make your game unplayable for anyone who can't actually use that device. If you have infinite time, money, and energy, go ahead and make a game for [theremin][theremin], for everyone else here is a look at common input devices.

## Mouse and Keyboard

Almost everyone who is on a computer has both of these, and for those who don't, you probably weren't designing a game to run on a command line only Linux system. 

### Trackpads



##Gamepad

###Switch Joycons

##Phone

If you are designing for touch devices, you should probably know that from the jump. I don't mess with these at all because I am a coward. But it would be remiss to not even mention them here. Direct tapping of specific points on the screen seems frustrating. The common solution to that is just having various gestures be inputs. Swiping in various ways, taps that don't care about position, number of taps, taps then swipes.
