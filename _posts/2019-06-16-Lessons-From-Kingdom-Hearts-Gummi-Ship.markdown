Structure
-Mention we just talked about levels
-how do we get between levels
-gummi ship
-the missions
-the building
-the shooting
-the portals
-the warping
-the point system?
-they keep doubling down on this shit


what lessons can we learn from this?


-make one good game before trying to make a second

Making games is difficult, it takes a lot of time, effort, and thought. Making a good game is even harder, cause even once you're done making the thing, you have to polish it. After all of that hard work, you still can't be entirely sure that you have something that other humans will like. So when you make an entirely new system that is a game within your game, you need to be *very* sure that it is a good idea.This isn't a small decision, it is effectively doubling your workload if you want to do it correctly.

The gummy ship does not have an especially meaningful connection to the main game. You can effectively ignore the gummy ship missions by just holding down the shoot button and moving into the corner. If you have extreme loathing for them, you can just treat them as extended loading screens that are a punishment for your hubris.

-connect all games in meaningful ways (both directions, gummy to main, main to gummy)

If you are going to have two or more games in one package, the parts need to meaningfully interact. This ideally would work both ways, the things you do in a disney world would be affected by the gummy missions and vice versa. This doesn't necessarily need to be the case, but if it isn't, I would start to question why the minigame is necessary.

 Plenty of games have minigames, but often those are copouts. The solution to a design problem in a game should ideally never be to make a new game with its own design problems. I view it as a last resort if you really want to depict an element of a setting.

-have all games fit the themes
