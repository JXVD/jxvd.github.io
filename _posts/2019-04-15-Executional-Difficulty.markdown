The first time I set out to write about Executional Difficulty as a concept was two years ago, and I wrote something nobody wants to read. It wasn't that the concept was difficult or that I didn't have a grasp on the subject, but I absolutely didn't write a thing that was fun to read. Having written only academic papers up to that point, it read like an academic paper, which is fine if you're a complete nerd. As a person who cares a lot about how people take in the content I make, it went on the shelf. So here is a second attempt, where I try to make the concepts bite-sized and actually interesting to read.

In any game there are really only two categories of difficulty, things that are hard to do with your hands, and things that are hard to do with your head. Things that are hard to do with your hands have what can be called Executional Difficulty. A game that is almost entirely executional difficulty is Dance Dance Revolution. Things that are hard to do with your head have what can be called Strategic Difficulty. A game that is almost entirely strategic difficulty is Chess. These are extremely broad categories that can be broken down in a lot of different ways. Having to memorize a lot of things at once and having to plan out a series of moves are definitely different challenges, but are both are grouped together as strategically difficult. Similarly, having to do a lot of preplanned actions very precisely and having to react to situations very quickly are different challenges, but both are grouped together as executionally difficult. Rigorously applying these ideas also runs into a few problems. 
Is having to visually parse a very chaotic scene an executional challenge or a strategic one?

If these definitions are so loose, why are these concept useful?  As a designer, how can I use these ideas to actually make a game better? The main reason to know that there are two main kinds of difficulty is that you can then tailor your game to remove all the kinds of difficulty you don't want and polish the kinds that you do. To start, we're going to look at a concept called Execution Tax. Execution Tax is a phrase taken from [David Sirlin][sirlin], and what it essentially means is a set of inputs required by a game that only asks the player to do some difficult input. If every time you wanted to jump in a platformer you got extra height by tapping the jump button five times in a row very quickly, that would be an execution tax. This would be especially true if there was almost never a time that a player didn't want to get the maximum height. Note that in this scenario, it doesn't matter if the people who made the platformer didn't know about the extra height input, players who really care about the game are still forced to deal with that tax.


What is and isn't an execution tax is pretty relative, and some games don't even need to worry about this at all. Applying this concept Dance Dance Revolution is just silly. 

The points where it is useful to have a thing be executionally difficult is when that executional difficulty significantly adds to the interesting parts of a game. That sounds obvious, "you should make the game more fun" is some of the least helpful advice possible, even if it is true. What I mean is that instead of just making something hard to do at all, it should be hard to do well. The two easiest ways to do this are to add granularity of execution, and the possibilty to make choices within a challenge that is executionally difficult.


What granularity of execution means is that there are a lot of ways to do a specific action. The most obvious example is aiming and firing in an FPS. There is a lot of difference between needing ten seconds to hit a target and needing one. There are a million different ways to make that specific action different and more or less challenging in every FPS.

Next time I'm going to be writing way too many words about parries in 3rd strike.

Note: In trying to verify if Sirlin came up with the phrase execution tax, I stumbled across [this post][sirlin2]. It really wouldn't surprise me if I read this at some point before, so I gotta give credit where it is due. I don't agree with everything Sirlin thinks about execution, but this one hews too close to what I'm saying to not mention it. I probably lived with this 

Second Note: The same is probably true about Mark Rosewater too, just assume I stole his ideas like I try to steal his style of writing about design.
