##Narratives and the FPS

With upcoming sequels to both Half Life 2 and Bioshock, we are forced to confront a deep truth. Neither game is actually good at telling a story. In the mid 2000s, nobody had accepted that First Person just isn't a good perspective to tell a direct narrative. This is because the player is expected to be embodying the main character. The audience literally can't see how the main character of the game changes over time. This is a crucial narrative tool eliminated from the jump. The other issue is that games are still very confused over whether or not a player's actions are the actions of the main character and vice versa. If they player does something, is it the same as the character doing so? If a game forces a player to do a bad thing to continue, who is responsible? Telling a story is hard enough as it is and FPS games start with both hands tied behind their back. 

Bioshock runs as hard as it possibly can into the player/character embodiment issue. The narrative gimmick of Bioshock is that the main character is a clone who must do everything they are told to if it is preceded with "would you kindly." I hate the narrative gimmick of Bioshock. If a player is expected to embody a character, the game probably shouldn't criticize the player just for being that character. The "Would you kindly" bit only works if the player was ever presented with an option to not follow the orders given. Every player has the option to not engage with a game, that's what quitting is.

Most games don't acknowledge that the player continuing to play is a choice the player is making. Bioshock tries to position the player and the character in the same place by saying that neither had a choice to not follow the game structure. This is a lie, the player and character are never compelled by anything other than the labyrinth the game constructs.

Half Life 2, on the other hand, runs into the player/character embodiment problem in a different way. Half Life 2 places the player in a position where they embody an extremely important character in the story. The game then never gives the player any agency. This means the main character also doesn't have any agency. Half Life tried to avoid confronting this problem by never acknowledging the player or the character directly. Instead it asks them to do incredibly dumb actions and refuses to talk about them. At one point the player has to get into a prison coffin in the middle of a alien military/government facility that transports them to the president's office. This is an absurd series of events that has to occur for the story to continue.

The player/main character gets talked at constantly, but can never respond. Is the main character mute? That's fine if they are, but the game needs to talk about that. Half Life 2 feels like a fever dream of a story. The player just floats through long levels without really ever understanding what is going on. When presented with an implied city to explore, the actual path is a weird sprawling maze that always spits you out where you need to be. There is no navigation or exploration of space, just trying to claw out of the maze.

Contrast both of these games with Portal, a game made with the exact same tools as Half Life 2. Portal tells a much better story. The main character is either a passive participant or doing exactly what the player would want to be doing at all times. The issue of who the player is exactly and dealing with character interaction is completely avoided. The plot comes from things the player is told by a narrator and things they find in the world. The player is never told explicitly that they want to do something, that the character they are embodying is anything other than a direct representation of the player. They are only told that they are supposed to complete some tests and are given no other options. 

When the narrative twist occurs, surviving is the same thing as continuing to play the game. What the main character wants is the same thing that the game incentivizes. The player wants to move through the game spaces and that is what the game compels you to do. The lack of implied agency or interaction with other characters frees the game up to tell a simple but well done story. 

The First Person perspective just isn't suited for narratives because there is no way to look at the main character or how they interact with others. This is compounded by the fact that as a medium, games still don't tackle the issue of who is responsible for what occurs in a story. Not only can the player not see the main character in the story, they can't even be sure what the story thinks that character did. The core FPS tool set just does not deal with anything other than a narratively static main character that doesn't grow or change. A lot of FPS games just avoid active narratives and character interaction, this is what the Walking Sim subgenre is doing. Until the genre as a whole starts to acknowledge that it can't effectively do narratives, we are going to be getting Half Life 2 and Bioshock forever.

(FOOTNOTE: The idea that a player always has the ability to not engage with a game is a Tom Francis concept that he said somewhere.) 
Footnote: Undertale actually deals the quitting problem beautifully. In one part of the game, you are asked to constantly reload your save game and it is shown as "determination" to continue. The player and the main character are brought together through that. if the player chose to quit there, then the character did as well.
