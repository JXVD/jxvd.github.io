With the upcoming sequels to both Half Life 2 and Bioshock, we are forced to confront a deep truth. Both of those games aren't that good at telling stories.


Half life problems
-innovations for innovations sake
-if you are going to place


contrast with portal, game made with same tools


Bioshock

Bioshock places you in a world blah blah blah

I hate the narrative gimmick of Bioshock. There is a real problem in games narrative where if the player is expected to embody a character, you probably shouldn't criticize the player for doing so. The "Would you kindly" bit only works if it was ever even implied that the player was ever given an option to not follow the orders given. If you only give the player one route forward, they weren't compelled by anything other than level structure. The only way out for the player would be to quit, which isn't an actual option most games are willing to acknowledge. Not engaging with the structures presented is always a valid option but Bioshock never presents quitting as a thing that exists in its world.

Footnote: Undertale actually gets at this problem beautifully in the first ending of the game where you are asked to constantly reload your save game and it is shown as "determination" to continue. the player and the main character are brought together through that. if the player chose to quit there, then the character did as well.


Half Life avoids this problem by never acknowledging the player. Instead it asks them to do incredibly dumb actions and then refuses to talk about it. Why does Gordon/The Player have to get into a prison coffin in the middle of a semi-alien military facility? The player gets talked at, is Gordon mute? That's fine if he is, but like, talk about that, give Gordon some agency. Half Life 2 feels like a fever dream of a story, the player just floats through very long levels without really ever understanding what is going on. The worst is the City 17 levels, where when presented with an implied city to explore, the actual path is a weird sprawling maze that always spits you out where you need to be. There is no navigation or exploration of space, just trying to claw out of the maze.



Contrast with Mirror's Edge

Mirror's Edge accepts what it can't do, story or a literal depiction of a world. So instead it makes an aesthetically gorgeous representation of a city. The way things are colored changes to note how Faith sees the world as a place to traverse.  This along with lovingly designed textures leads to The City feeling like a real place. This is also helped by the fact that the game is entirely based around physically interacting with the environment, jumping off roofs, climbing up pipes, dropping off scaffolding. 

The story gets told through animation that is outside of what the player experiences in first person. When the game is in first person, the sotry is nonsensical. Why do I like this version of floating through a space and not Half Life's? The world feels much more like a subjective space that Faith is looking at. I know who Faith is, despite the pretty bad plotting, the actual words that she says feel real. I get what she wants, I know why I'm running through these weird corporate facilities. It makse sense to me why I'm climbing up a large atrium to grab a sniper rifle to shoot out the engine of a police van that is carrying my framed sister to inevitable death.
