Having gotten this far into talking about Kingdom Hearts, we need to adress the elephant in the room. "What the shit is going on with these clothes?" I hear you ask. "Is Sora wearing a onesie under a jacket? Does Riku have balloon pants with ankle belts?" Yes, and only God may forgive us all for being part of this.

Character design is extremely important, how a character looks and dresses dictates a lot about what we feel when we play as those characters. Sora has rosy cheeks which let us know that he is still a child on the cusp of adolesence. He also dresses like a clown which lets us know about his family and family history in the circus. Riku wears all black, which lets us know that he is mad supercool.

There isn't much to say about this design wise other than to express this

### Clothes and Character design dictate character personality and world lore

Why does Sora look like he is ready to pop some X and dance to Prodigy's "Smack My Bitch Up?" What is this world that is Destiny Islands? All the other characters that aren't story important don't dress this weird. Kairi just has a tank top and skirt. Kairi also says and does very little over the course of the series, so maybe this is just good lore building from the start.

I can't that something purely aesthetic is necessarily wrong. I think that there is a lot of stuff going on with the character designs in KH that just confuse and upset me. If you're going to steal character design secrets from a Final Fantasy designer, try [Amano][amano].
