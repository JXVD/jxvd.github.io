[Last week][last-week] I wrote about really disliking difficulty settings in games. I said that I didn't want to be asked to design a game for fun, which is what beign allowed to vary all the sliders feels like to me. "But Jackson!" I hear you say, "surely you can't feel this way about all settings and choices in games, surely you are a hypocrite in some ways!" You're right, I am a hypocrite, and there are a lot of things that I don't mind being asked to design for fun in games. If I'm going to rail against difficulty settings in one way, I better explain why I feel how I do about difficulty settings and options that I do like.






Now I probably wouldn't have this problem if these difficulty options were presented as a mod. Something from outside the game system that changes it, but because the menus are readily at my fingertips, I conciously have to ignore them.
I understand that this is silly, and including stuff like photography modes in games doesn't cheapen them. 

I just like my games to be more monolithic in nature, I want to be given a well made thing and interact with it. 
//something about how no game is everything for everyone, and how even a singular piece of media will be looked at in a million different ways



Next time I will talk about what overt difficulty systems I do like

Part two






TOUHOU
IWBTG?

Short iteration time = more ok to talk about the difficulty


Designing around this
-Make sure players know whats up before playing
