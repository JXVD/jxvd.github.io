Now I probably wouldn't have this problem if these difficulty options were presented as a mod. Something from outside the game system that changes it, but because the menus are readily at my fingertips, I conciously have to ignore them.
I understand that this is silly, and including stuff like photography modes in games doesn't cheapen them. 

I just like my games to be more monolithic in nature, I want to be given a well made thing and interact with it. 
//something about how no game is everything for everyone, and how even a singular piece of media will be looked at in a million different ways



Next time I will talk about what overt difficulty systems I do like

Part two






TOUHOU
IWBTG?

Short iteration time = more ok to talk about the difficulty


Designing around this
-Make sure players know whats up before playing
