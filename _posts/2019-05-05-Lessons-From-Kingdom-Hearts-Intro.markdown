#Lessons from Kingdom Hearts
## Part 1

Kingdom Hearts is the worst game ever made. I love Kingdom Hearts. 

Kingdom Hearts is a crucible for men's souls.


Kingdom Hearts is the worst game ever made. I used to think this was just due to ineptitude on the part of the game's lead designer, Tetsuya Nomura. "How could one man make all the wrong decisions at every point?" I would ask myself. "If he were just randomly guessing on which design decisions to make, he would have made a better game." Then after all the long hours of forcing myself through the game in what can only be considered a cry for help, I understood. **Kingdom Hearts is a crucible for men's souls.** It is a game meant to hurt, and it is meant to purify the player, so they can truly grasp to depth and beauty that is the batshit crazy plot of the Kingdom Hearts series.

I love Kingdom Hearts, I can not stress this enough. I also truly believe that the first game in the series is the *worst game ever made*. It brings me great pain and great joy to know that Kingdom Hearts 1 exists and is a thing that people choose to play. I love the insanity that is the plot. I love the sheer design creativity in coming up with endless ways to be a bad game. This is why I'm going to be spending quite a lot of time delving into the design decisions that were made in Kingdom Hearts 1. We're going to look at why these decisions were made and how we can learn from them.

Before I start analyzing parts of the game, I need to clarify exactly what I am doing here. I am not a genius soothsayer like Tetsuya Nomura. I do not know how to cleanse a player's soul through a video game. So when I look at a design decision that was made, I have to make assumptions as to why it was done that way. I also have to say what I think the problems are with the design. I can't profess to know how to cause deep and lasting religious experiences in the player. All I can say is what I think a design should be if the purpose of the game was player enjoyment.


The first place to start is exactly where Sora does, in a haze of confusion. The game begins after a very rad AMV in an intro sequence. You fight a few enemies, get confused by the ui and then come to the first of a long series of vague decisions.

###### Choose one of these


Given the choice of sword, shield, and rod, you need to choose one to focus on. You also need to choose one to neglect. This will have extreme and far ranging implications on the actual enjoyment of the game. There is literally no way to know in the game what this means blah blah blah

AJ was apologizing for telling me the wrong choice

The questions about friends and importance and stuff



So what is the lesson to learn from these vague choices being asked in the intro?
### Always tell the player the importance of their choices

I am all for vaguery in games. I am super down to be confused for an hour. I am far less down to be confused for twenty hours.
