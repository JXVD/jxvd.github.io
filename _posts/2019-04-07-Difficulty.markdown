I hate difficulty options in games. Whenever I start a game and am given the option to choose how hard the game will be, I abstain. I just choose the medium difficulty and hope that the game was designed around that one option. I get it, designing interactions is super hard, and what any given player will find reasonably difficulty is wildly different. I'm super sympathetic to that problem, I would just rather find a game to be too easy than to be asked to design a game for fun. As a designer I really can't know what skill level or expectations the players of the game are going to have. I just have to trust that I am making a thing that will be a good experience for at least some of the people who touch the game. As a player, I really can't know what level of skill the designer expects me to have and what 

In-game difficulty changes/whatever breaks immersion
Games can't be everything for everyone.


The Dark Souls/Bloodborne/Sekiro series is probably the most popular "hard" game in the modern games landscape. The Dark Souls DLC version of the game was called "Prepare to Die Edition." It is true that the games are difficult for most players. This is especially true if you try to go and beat them without help or knowledge. What the Souls series does especially well in a very sneaky way is to let players choose their own difficulty without even telling them thats what they are doing.  Without ever breaking out of the immersion of the game, people can go out and summon friends to help them with difficult parts. Without ever being told that their choice is lesser, players go and choose a magic build that will let them get through the game much easier. Without ever being stopped from doing so, players can grind for levels as long as they like, there are even some pretty good spots to do so near the start of the game. All of this lets players choose their difficulty settings without ever being asked to design the game. From Software already did the work and the player gets to reap the benefits.

Another game that lets players choose their own difficulty in their own way is Heat Signature. As a game highly inspired by immersive sims, Heat Signature lets players find their own fun and generally tries to get them embroiled in as many shenangins as possible. Instead of the obtuse roundabout way of Dark Souls, Heat Signature just tells the player what difficulty any mission they choose will be. It also tells players exactly what they'll need to prepare for to beat the mission. Then the game does its damndest to entice the player to make mistakes. Tom Francis [wrote about all this][heat-sig], so I won't get too deep into it but the point is that the game is very concious about how hard it is to play at all times.(Side note, Tom Francis is great designer and writer, and [writer about design][Tom-Francis])

There is only one thing I really dislike about how Heat Signature deals with difficulty, and it is that the game also includes a menu to completely change how the game works. This just loops back into the central problem of being asked to design a game. 

//segue into celeste


This is also a solution that Celeste came up with. At any point in the game, the player can open the options menu to completely change how their character interacts with the world. This can be used to completely circumvent the difficult platforming that makes up the majority of the gameplay interactions.

I like celeste a lot, I understand why the option to edit the game was put in. There are a lot of people who would enjoy being in that world and playing that easier game lets them have that. The story is touching,the art is wonderful, and the music is uplifiting, so experiencing those all together is a powerful thing. I think that overall being given those options made the game better for a lot of people who aren't me. Clearly I still liked the game despite the options menu, but I have an unhealthy obsession with details so I can't ignore that menu all of the time. It doesn't matter that the difficulty menu wasn't intended by Matt Makes Games, it is in the game so it is an option that is readily available to me. I feel like it cheapens my experience in that I instead of getting frustrated at a difficult platforming challenge, I sometimes get frustrated at myself for not just going into the options menu to just beat the thing easily. 


Now I probably wouldn't have this problem if these difficulty options were presented as a mod. Something from outside the game system that changes it, but because the menus are readily at my fingertips, I conciously have to ignore them.
I understand that this is silly, and including stuff like photography modes in games doesn't cheapen them. 

I just like my games to be more monolithic in nature, I want to be given a well made thing and interact with it. 
//something about how no game is everything for everyone, and how even a singular piece of media will be looked at in a million different ways



Next time I will talk about what overt difficulty systems I do like

Part two



TOUHOU
IWBTG?

Short iteration time = more ok to talk about the difficulty


Designing around this
-Make sure players know whats up before playing
