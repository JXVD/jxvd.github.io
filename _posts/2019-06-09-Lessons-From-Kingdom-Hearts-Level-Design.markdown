Now that we've gone through the intro, we hit the next intro. We're going to ignore that for right this instant. I think we need to address the elephant in the room. What do you actually do in Kingdom Hearts? Other than the obvious answer, suffer to purification, the answer to wander. Much like Dante, we must journey through the realms of hell, such that we might emerge through the bottom of the earth, passing by Satan frozen in his pit, so far from the warmth of anything that is good in this world. With Jiminy Cricket as their Vergil, the group of dipshits that is the main party just wander aimlessly through each disney world they arrive at.

This sounds like hyperbole but it really is what occurs. The gang arrives on a world after having to deal with a gummy ship mission. They land on that world after some plot justification puts them there. Then there is a small cutscene, then you wander around trying to find where the next cutscene is. Sometimes the cutscene is just found by wandering through areas. Sometimes you need to talk to an NPC. Sometimes the cutscene is gated by a fight, but that fight will not be visibly marked, so you better just fight everyone

Once you find this cutscene, you might vaguely be told the next thing to do, or you might not. Either way, you are put back into the world to wander once again to find the next cutscene. Once this is done enough times you will fight a boss. This will then seem like an ending to the world, but it might not be. Or it could be? You don't actually need to beat every world. Beating the boss is required to beat the world. There is also something about sealing the keyhole, which seems like it is relevant to completing the game. The characters certainly act like it is. It isn't. You don't need to do that, the only change if you do is that you have to clear one less room in the endgame. That's it.

And that is everything you do in Kingdom Hearts.


### Give the player consistent direction or at least some idea of what is important

It is endlessly frustrating to try and figure out the next thing you are supposed to do. This is compounded by the extremely unituitive world design and constant pointless fights. It is really difficult to remember what it is that you are supposed to do at any given point in time. This is especially true if you are coming back to the game after time away. Unlike a tv show, where you can reasonably expect each viewer to finish each episode in order, a game can be played for variable lengths of time and order.
//bad final sentence rewrite

At any given point in time it is important for the player to be aware of what they can do to advance the game state.
 This doesn't mean that a game needs to have a glowing arrow every step of the way, but it does mean that a player shouldn't have to wonder what the possibility space of actions is. There is never any real response or feedback from Kingdom Hearts that tells a player that they are doing correct actions. They are passive observers to the events that occur in the game. They wander into a location, watch things happen to other people, then have to wander again. There is no sense of agency because the players are never allowed to be agents. The wandering never feels purposeful, it never feels exploratory. It feels desperate, desolate, trying to escape the ten second loops of knockoff disney music for just a brief fleeting moment of cutscene.


 The obvious contrast here is the metroidvania genre, a type of game where there is often no other purpose than roaming around an area. In a good metroidvania, there is a real sense of discovery as you explore a space. Learning it as you go back and forth as the space recontexutializes with your abilities. 
 KH on the other hand, never devolps your ability to explore the space in any meaningful way. Yes you do eventually get the ability to High Jump and Glide, but those don't really give access to new spaces in old worlds. They don't even really come up in the new worlds either.

 They hid high jump in a chest, why. 







If Sora was just following his goal, he'd dip from every world once he realized his friends weren't here. There is a real disconnect between the urgency of the plot where Sora can't stop talking about finding his friends, and the slow pace of dicking about with Tarzan.
